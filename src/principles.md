#### The Main Idea : Making the world of tomorrow better today

The guiding principle of the party is that in order for us to progress as a society,
the world we leave behind today must be a little better than the world of yesterday.
Of course we will always experience setbacks as a society, but the general methods we use must guarantee that in
the long-term our moral codes, technology, productivity, and environment are steadily increasing in relation to time.

If we can achieve this then we can guarantee that the society our children live in will be better than our own, and the society of our children's children will be even better than that of their parents.

We can not do this if as a society we refuse to communicate with one another, if we accumulate more and more debt, if we create more legislation that patches problems but does not solve them in a future oriented long-term way, or if we allow our political systems to be corrupted by biases built-in over time.

In essence, we are a party concerned not with the short term but with the long term.


#### The Moral Code

In general, our party strives to optimize along two vectors which are important for all human beings and not just citizens of our own countries and societies.

The first is human flourishing, which we'll broadly define as being in a state of happiness, being healthy and prosperous, but also being able to act out upon and follow one's inner motivations and drives so long as those do not infringe upon the same rights of other individuals in our society. Our party has the explicit aim to maximize for human flourishing.

The second vector is human suffering and it is this property which we strive to minimize within our societies. Human suffering is not only pain but also the state of distress and the inability to self-actualize and act on the core motivations and drives which one experiences in life.

So our moral objectives are simple: maximize human flourishing and minimize human suffering.

#### The First Pillar : A Balanced Budget

If we can't pay our bills then we can't do anything. We can't provide social programs to our needy.
We can't ensure our country is safe from foreign aggressions. We can't even feed or house ourselves and our loved-ones much less
innovate and improve our social systems over time.

This is why we place our foot firmly down at a simple and boring place - at the books as it were.

We think we should not overspend and should conduct ourselves in a responsible and future oriented manner.

#### The Second Pillar : Social Liberalism

Although our party is fiscally conservative - i.e. we believe we should balance our budgets in order to guarantee
progress for future generations - we are socially liberal. This means we believe all members of society, themselves a part of
government through the process of taxation, should be treated equally under the law.

We believe that LGBTQ men and women have the same rights to marriage, adoption and all other opportunities as do their heterosexual counterparts.

We believe that a woman has a right to choose but reject the proposition that tax dollars should fund abortions, believing this to currently be the necessary choice since any alternative violates the rights to human flourishing of one side or the other.

We believe that the goal of the prison complex and our correctional systems should not be punishment but rehabilitation.

These are some of our current social stances on issues but like all of them they are open to challenge and debate, because our party process defines a method where nothing is dogma, and everything can and should be questioned and discussed in open civil debate.

That is our core social belief - in the dialectic, in the power of dialogue and civil discourse and discussion - not in party politics and my side vs. your side attitudes. The Open Party is a party for all sides where people can agree to disagree and live in harmony with one another. It is a party opposed to authoritarianism in all its incantations whether that be the zealot trying to force a religious dogma into public schools, or the radical left-wing ideologue attacking peacefully gathered students on a college campus.

#### The Third Pillar : A Strong National Defense

The world is unfortunately not a utopia and humans still wage war on one another.

In order to insure the safety and well-being of our citizens, it is regrettably necessary to have a strong and technologically advanced defense military system.

To be clear, our party does not support foreign aggressions on other countries, realizing that the context does matter and debate is to be had on an issue by issue basis, we in general reject the notion that our country should have any military involvement in world affairs other than for national defense purposes.

Still, to maintain the safety of our citizens, humanity at large, and to ensure human flourishing into the future a military should be maintained and it should be swift, efficient, and technologically advanced.  

#### The Process

All of our party's main pillars, quell in comparison to our guiding process.

Its this process that can give us the guarantees about the future we want to have, because we know that if we do make a mistake as a society, either morally, politically, or economically, it will be corrected - so long as our laws, regulations and party goals are themselves subject to the time tested scientific method of inquiry.

For instance, every policy we choose to implement should be tested on a regular basis to determine whether or not its achieving the specific goals of the policy (themselves always deriving from our overarching aims of maximizing human flourishing and minimizing human suffering).

It is this process, which will allow us to make hypotheses about social welfare systems, test them, and iteratively arrive at systems that improve over the course of time.

The general form of the process is as follows. We have a goal we want to achieve in our society, for instance, making quality health care available for everyone in our society, we then make hypotheses about the best ways to achieve this goal, in terms of affordability, self-sustainability, etc. We take these various hypotheses and tests them, in trials or in simulations or both, we analyze the results and select the best systems, and finally we apply them in our policies. But it doesn't end there, now we begin evaluating those very policies and systems over time, measuring their effectiveness and ability to achieve the aims for which they have been designed, making iterative adjustments or total rehauls depending on the data analyses.

This process is itself simply the scientific method and is a long proven means for iteratively optimizing systems.

Finally, in order to improve our moral, political, and societal structures from one generation to the next, we cannot tie ourselves to any particular political ideology such as conservatism, social liberalism, environmentalism, or any such -ism, but actively choose to guide ourselves by the scientific process and our simple moral code.

#### The Summary of the Party Principles

The Open Party is built on these three pillars, a simple moral code, and a time tested iterative process.

Fundamentally we are a party driven by this scientific process and dedicated to openness of mind and a moral code that optimizes for human well-being.

If you find yourself in agreement with this sentiment - or in staunch disagreement with the principles we've outlined - we'd like to hear from you, because only together can we shape a better future for humanity.
